Experiments show that local plant species loss reduces ecosystem functioning and services, but the role of spatial homogenization of community composition and the potential interaction between diversity at different scales in maintaining ecosystem functioning remains unclear, especially when many functions are considered (ecosystem multifunctionality). We present an analysis of eight ecosystem functions measured in 65 grasslands worldwide. We find that more diverse grasslands—those with both species-rich local communities (α-diversity) and large compositional differences among localities (β-diversity)—had higher levels of multifunctionality. Moreover, α- and β-diversity synergistically affected multifunctionality, with higher levels of diversity at one scale amplifying the contribution to ecological functions at the other scale. The identity of species influencing ecosystem functioning differed among functions and across local communities, explaining why more diverse grasslands maintained greater functionality when more functions and localities were considered. These results were robust to variation in environmental drivers. Our findings reveal that plant diversity, at both local and landscape scales, contributes to the maintenance of multiple ecosystem services provided by grasslands. Preserving ecosystem functioning therefore requires conservation of biodiversity both within and among ecological communities.","tags":["nutnet","Multifunctionality"],"title":"Local loss and spatial homogenization of plant diversity reduce ecosystem multifunctionality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Devan Allen McGranahan","Sally Archibald","Kevin P.

Changes that introduce substantially different fuel types can alter the spatial extent of fire, with potential impacts on community succession and biodiversity. Montane grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa are threatened by climate change because species distributions can shift with climatically determined ranges. We studied the impact of patches of the temperate C3 grass Festuca costata in C4-dominated grassland at the transition between their subalpine ranges in South Africa’s Drakensberg. We used empirical data on fuel moisture and fuel load across F. costata-dominated patches in a C4-dominated matrix in fire spread models to predict the effect of larger, higher-moisture F. costata patches on the spatial extent of fire. Results indicate F. costata reduces fire spread and burn probability in F. costata patches, and the effect increases as live fuel moisture increases and patches get larger. However, as a native species, F. costata does not appear to have the extreme, fire-suppressing effect of non-native C3 grasses in other C4 grasslands. Instead, F. costata patches likely increase variability in the spatial extent of fire in this C4-dominated grassland, which likely translates to spatial variability on vegetation succession.","tags":["fire","C3-grass"],"title":"A native C3 grass alters fuels and fire spread in montane grassland of South Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530136800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530136800,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.
